We mostly use our own contracts, but if clients prefer to use their contracts (and they look ok), that's fine too.

R for the Rest of Us contract templates live in PandaDoc. There are three main templates that we adapt as appropriate:

1. The [R for the Rest of Us Client Service Agreement](https://app.pandadoc.com/a/#/templates/dKnzNZCNLWytydj859stoB) is for training and consulting engagements.
2. The [R for the Rest of Us Master Consulting Services Agreement Template](https://app.pandadoc.com/a/#/templates/k8EqrCmJwoQGbiUPUTcDBj) is for hiring contractors.
3. The [R for the Rest of Us Course Creation Agreement](https://app.pandadoc.com/a/#/templates/nCvjHXXYP4gBGYnWe8ov5Y) is for partnering with instructors to create courses.

We are likely switching to using Google Docs for contracts moving forward.
