Once they’re on the list, we send them regular emails that educate them about R, interspersing emails that attempt to sell them on our offerings.\nThe specifics of how our email marketing system works comes largely from Brennan Dunn’s Mastering ConvertKit course. The process gets fairly complicated, but at the highest level, here’s what it does:\nBelow are details about how email automations work. Note that sequences aren’t included because they are generally just called from Visual Automations below.",

This does the following:\n\nAssigns the tag Customer - Course/Workshop\nAssigns the tag Customer\nAssigns the tag Flag - Calculate Next offer (which sends them through the Function - Calculate Next Offer - Automation)\nAssigns the Flag - Remove from Shadow Newsletter tag, which does what it says\nPuts them through the Getting Started - Signup - Sequence, which sends a set of emails about the course\nWhen they complete the course or the Getting Started - Signup - Sequence, they get pulled to the end and go into the Fundamentals - Bridge - Automation\n\nThe Fundamentals - Bridge - Automation pitches people on Fundamentals. It happens in two ways depending on what the user has done so far on Getting Started.\n\nIf the user has the Completed - Getting Started tag, they go into the Fundamentals - Bridge - Hot. This goes straight to the pitch for Fundamentals.\nIf the user has not completed Getting Started, they go into the Fundamentals - Bridge - Cold. This sends them a few emails before pitching them on Fundamentals.\n\nAfter they go through the bridge sequences, they go into the Fundamentals - Pitch - Automation.\n\nThe tag Flag - Pitch Window Open - Fundamentals gets applied. This triggers Zapier to create a personalized coupon on WooCommerce.\nThe user gets an email on Friday telling them their personal window is open to purchase Fundamentals.\nThe user goes through the Fundamentals - Pitch - Sequence, which sends an email every day the next week with info on purchasing Fundamentals.\nThe tag Completed - Onboarding is applied.\nThe tag Flag - Start Shadow Newsletter is applied. This triggers the Shadow Newsletter - Automation and adds them to the shadow newsletter.\n\n\n\nOther Courses\n\nIf they sign up for a course, each Woo products assigns them the appropriate tag (e.g. Purchased - Fundamentals).\nThen, they go through a visual automation for each course (e.g. Fundamentals - Signup - Automation)\nThen, this automation rule assigns them the tag Flag - New Subscriber.\n\n\n\nR in 3 Months\n\nIf they sign up for R in 3, WooCommerce assigns them the tag Purchased - R in 3 Months.\nThen, they go through this visual automation, which sends them an email that welcomes them. All other communication about R in 3 Months happens directly via Gmail.\n\n\n\nNewsletter\nIf someone signs up for the newsletter using this form, the following happens:\n\nThe Flag - New Subscriber tag is added to them through this automation rule\n\nThe Flag - New Subscriber tag puts them into the Global - Welcome - Sequence using this automation rule\n\nThe Flag - New Subscriber tag being added puts them onto the New Subscriber - Automation\nThe New Subscriber - Automation moves them through the Function - Calculate Next Offer - Automation and Function - Tag Custom Training/Consulting Clients - Automation\nThe New Subscriber - Automation moves them through the Function - Calculate Topics vs Core Courses\n\nIf they are a custom training/consulting client, they get the Completed - Onboarding and the Flag - Start Shadow Newsletter tags applied, which moves them onto the shadow newsletter\nIf they are not a custom training/consulting client, they are moved to the Getting Started - Pitch - Automation (if they haven’t signed up for it already)\n\n\n\n\nYou can do that with R\nNote: This one is basically archived. It was a lead magnet early on but isn’t really necessary anymore because most people sign up for Getting Started.\n\nIf user signs up for you can do that, it happens with this form.\nThen, this automation rule assigns them the tag Flag - New Subscriber.",

Make the default view a Kanban (see example here) so the client can see the status of various tasks.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to using GitHub to manage code, we also use Todoist to keep track of due dates. For each project, we create a corresponding project on Todoist. Within that project, put various deadlines. Make sure to add the label deadline to the tasks (this way, David can see them in a special view he has created). Here’s an example:\n\nIt’s generally ok to move due dates as necessary (please just ask David if you have questions about whether it is a problem on any specific project). Please just update the due dates on the project README on GitHub to match.\n\n\n\nCreate a thread in the #consulting channel on Twist for the project. If it is large project, we can create a separate channel just for the project so we can have multiple threads.\nTwist is a good place for things we’d like to keep confidential (because we work more and more with clients directly in GitHub, that isn’t the best place for confidential discussions). Also, while Todoist has the ability to communicate within tasks, it’s not as user friendly as Twist so we use Twist for general communication.",

Things like “90% of people do X” rather than “Percent of people who do X.” The rationale for this is laid out in this article by Stephanie Everegreen.\nWe declutter our charts by removing unnecessary elements. Here’s an example of such a chart. Note that we have removed most grid lines, and the y axis title. This makes the data easier to read and make sense of.\n\nWe explain by using annotations where possible.\nWe make our charts sparkle by using custom fonts and custom themes. We have an internal custom theme in the rfortherestofus package.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut more often, we create a custom theme for clients we work with. This involves using their fonts and colors. In cases where clients have branding guidelines, we use those. If not, we get colors and fonts from their website and use them."

No need to go 100% Marie Kondo, but please try to keep it neat. Not only does it look more professional, it also encourages people to focus on what you’re teaching, not whatever random object is on your bookshelf.\nPlease use an external microphone. Try to keep it as close to you as possible, though I generally try to keep it off screen.\nAdjust your screen resolution. Adjusting your screen resolution makes your code much easier to read.\nWorking on a Mac, I go to Settings &gt; Displays and select 1024 x 576 (HiDPI). As Egghead explains about HiDPI:\n\nHiDPI mode—also known broadly as DPI scaling, or Retina display on Macs—doubles each pixel, allowing for highly readable text on very high-resolution screens.\n\nThere are some instructions for doing the same thing on Windows here.\nPlease hit the top menu bar when you record. Please go into full screen mode in RStudio. This hides your top menu bar and keeps the focus on your code.\n\nPlease use an external webcam. They tend to be higher quality than built-in ones.\nIf you are interested in learning more tips about high-quality screencasting, this guide from Egghead is helpful.\n\n\nRecording Lessons in Descript\nYou will record videos using Descript. It’s a great tool and has extensive documentation.\nPlease create a new project for each lesson. Use the blue new project button, not the classic project option.\n\nHere’s how to record a lesson.\n\n\n\nYou can re-record as much as you’d like.

This ensures that any times the instructor paused to gather their thoughts etc, those blank spaces are removed.\nLeave 0.25 seconds gaps between clips where the instructor is on camera and clips where they’re showing their screen.\nWhen there are two back-to-back clips of the speaker on camera, do a 0.5 second crossfade so the jump isn’t too abrupt.\nWhere appropriate, use stock videos/photos on Descript to highlight a concept.\nYou can zoom into sections of the screen on Descript. For example, in a video showing the pieces of RStudio, it may make sense to zoom into each one as I discuss it. Make zooms quicker — around 1 second.\nWhere appropriate, use callout boxes, arrows, and text to draw the learner’s attention to a specific area of the screen (for example, when the instructor says “you can see here…”).
