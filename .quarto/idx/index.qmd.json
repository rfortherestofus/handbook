Self-paced and cohort-based courses\n\n2.  In-person public workshops\n\n3.  Custom training for organizations\n\n### Consulting\n\nOn the consulting side, we do a range of projects. Almost all of them involve some combination of:\n\n1.  Data visualization\n\n2.  Using R to improve workflows\n\n3.  Automating reporting (especially with parameterized reporting)\n\n## Roadmap\n\nAs a business that does both education and consulting work, the R for the Rest of Us roadmap is guided by internal and external factors.

I also want it to be a business with a social conscience. We put this into practice by:\n\n1.  Highlighting important issues in the work we do (e.g. the types of projects we work on)\n\n2.
