## Outline

You'll start out by creating an outline of your course. This will be
done in the GitHub repo that David creates for your course.

Please just create an outline.Rmd file for this. Use the following
format:

**Section Name (H1)**

**Lesson Title (H2)**

Overview of lesson

**My Turn (H3)**

Overview of what you'll demonstrate

**Your Turn (H3)**

Exercise for student

**Solutions Code (H3)**

Code used for solution to Your Turn

**Learn More (H3)**

Text with additional info, resources, etc on topic of lesson

## Sections

R for the Rest of Us courses are broken up into lessons and sections.
Related lessons should be combined into sections. For example, my
Fundamentals of R course has sections on RMarkdown, Data Wrangling and
Analysis, and Data Visualization. ![](assets/course-sections.png)

## Lessons

The number of lessons varies by course. However, as a general rule, core
courses tend to be longer (between 30 and 40 lessons) while topics
courses tend to be shorter (15 to 30 lessons).

Each lesson should cover one distinct topic. Each lesson within a
section should be short and focus on a single topic. As you're making
your materials, if you think that a video demonstrating the concept will
go beyond 10 minutes or so, consider breaking it into multiple lessons.

Each lesson has the following sections:

1.  Video overview
2.  Your Turn exercise (some lessons don't lend themselves to this and
    don't have an exercise)
3.  Code and video solutions (only if there is a Your Turn)
4.  Learn More section with links to resources on that topic

Here's what it looks like (you can see this lesson
[here](https://rfortherestofus.com/lessons/group_by/)).

I typically start a lesson with slides. I'll start with a slide that
lays out the concept. I'll often have code on this slide. 

I'll usually then flip over to RStudio to show myself typing out the code to
demonstrate this concept in an exercises file. I call this the My Turn. Here's a sample lesson.

## Materials

The materials for each courses lives in a GitHub repo on the R for the Rest of Us
organization account. David will create this and add you to the repo.

### Slides

Slides for R for the Rest of Us courses are made using the [`xaringan`
package](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan).

There is a custom template to use to make slides in the R for the Rest
of Us style. You can access this by installing the [`rfortherestofus`
package](https://github.com/rfortherestofus/rfortherestofus) using the
following code:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rfortherestofus/rfortherestofus")
```

You can then add slides by going to File > New File > RMarkdown and selecting the R for the Rest of Us template.

Please create a `slides` directory where all of your slides will live.

You can create slides as follows:

Most lessons should have a My Turn and a Your Turn section. The slide
for the My Turn section should have an orange background and the slide
for the Your Turn section should have a dark background. To do this, add the class `my-turn` and the class `inverse` to your
slides as follows:

### Other Materials

Any other materials that you want people to access can live in the repo. Please organize however you see fit.
