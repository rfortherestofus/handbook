We produce two types of content: free and paid content. The free content is inteded to drive awareness of and signups for paid content. 

## Free Content

We use free content to build authority so that people see R for the Rest of Us as worth purchasing things (courses, custom training, consulting services) from us.

In 2024, I plan to produce 4 different types of content:

1. **Long-form blog posts** and accompanying **YouTube videos** (one blog post/video every other week)
2. **R in 2 Minutes YouTube videos** and accompanying **blog posts** that highlight one tip in 2 minutes or less (one video every four weeks)
3. **What's New in R** emails that highlight three interesting packages/tutorials/etc in each email (one email every other week)
4. **Podcast** episodes (also released as **YouTube videos**) featuring interviews with people doing unique things with R (one episode every four weeks)

Each of these items gets sent out via [email](email-marketing.qmd) and [social media](social-media.qmd).

### Long-Form Blog Posts and YouTube Videos

Blog posts are written in the [blog repo](https://github.com/rfortherestofus/blog) as Quarto files. 

From there, they are imported as blog posts on the website using the procedures outlined [here](https://github.com/rfortherestofus/rfortherestofus.com?tab=readme-ov-file#quarto-importer).

Joe creates a featured image for the blog post using AI and this Canva template (TODO: add link). 

Almost all blog posts have an accompanying YouTube video. 

David records the video in Descript.

Joe edits the video and uploads it to YouTube. 

Joe also creates a thumbnail by adapting the blog post featured image template in the right size for YouTube. 

YouTube videos are scheduled to go live a few hours before the blog post to ensure the videos show up.

The day a new blog post goes live, we also send out an email at 5:00am announcing it. David writes this email. Joe then adapts the email into a LinkedIn post that goes out at 8:00am. 

### R in 2 Minutes Blog Posts and YouTube Videos

Here are the steps to make and promote R in 2 Minutes videos.

1. First, David records the video on Descript.
1. David writes a short text intro for the video.
1. Next, Joe edits the video, adding the R in 2 Minutes intro and outro.
1. Joe creates a thumbnail using the R in 2 Minutes template in the [YouTube thumbnails project on Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF9nXMmRH0/9wfI47oEUa20zFF20tcKGQ/edit?utm_content=DAF9nXMmRH0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton).
1. Joe uploads the video to YouTube, setting the release date on the day the blog post is set to go live.
1. Joe makes sure the YouTube video has a link to the blog post in the description. 
1. Joe adds the thumbnail to the YouTube video.
1. Joe takes the text intro and creates a new blog post. 
1. Joe adds the thumbnail as the social image for the blog post in the SEO section. 
1. Joe sets up an email to go out at 5:00am the day the blog post goes live (see text below).
1. On the day that the R in 2 Minutes blog post and video is scheduled, Joe also sets the video to go up on LinkedIn. The LinkedIn post should just use the intro text as the body of the post.
1. Joe adds everything to the content calendar.

You can watch a video walkthrough of this here:

### What's New in R Emails

1. David writes content that is posted on the [What's New in R Netlify website](https://whatsnewwithr.netlify.app/)

1. [Post is added to website](https://rfortherestofus.com/cp/collections/blog).
1. [All resources mentioned in What's New in R email should be added as resources on the R for the Rest of Us website](https://rfortherestofus.com/cp/collections/resources/entries/create/default).

### Podcast (Audio and Video)

Podcast episodes are recorded using Squadcast. 

From there, the raw video files are downloaded and imported into Descript. Joe lines up the files manually so that the screencast portion of the interview is aligned with the other video files. Podcast episodes should be edited using the video files. Please use the [side by side template](https://web.descript.com/11d9eca5-cccd-4bd0-8c71-09fa78670076). 

Once a complete video version is created, a copy is made to create an audio version. In the audio version, the first half of the podcast is included, but as soon as the screenshare starts, we insert an audio clip of David saying "look at show notes for link to screencast."

#### Ads

The goal of all content is to get people on the R for the Rest of Us email list. Toward this end, we insert ads in podcast episodes (both audio and video versions). 

In the audio versions, we find a place about halfway through and insert an ad telling people to sign up for the newsletter and put a link to the R for the Rest of Us newsletter in the podcast notes.

In the video versions, we add a link to the R for the Rest of Us newsletter in the video description.

#### Release Schedule

Podcast episodes are released every other week, on weeks when there is not a new blog post. 

## Paid Content

Courses are obviously paid content, as are consulting and custom training.
