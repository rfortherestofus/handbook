title: "Social Media"
---

Social media is the main marketing strategy to help people become aware of R for the Rest of Us. The main platforms we use are YouTube and LinkedIn.

All social media is designed not so much to sell directly (though we do a bit of this), but to get people on the R for the Rest of Us email list (see [Email Marketing](email-marketing.html)). Once they are on that list, we attempt to educate them and convince them to buy products form us.

## YouTube

Almost all blog posts we produce have an accompanying video posted on YouTube. The YouTube video should include a link back to the blog post in the hope of getting people to sign up for the email list.

## LinkedIn

We use LinkedIn to post content that we create. This includes:

- What's New in R emails
- Blog posts and accompanying YouTube videos
- Podcast episodes
