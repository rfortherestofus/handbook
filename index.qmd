Welcome! You are reading an in-progress version of the R for the Rest of Us handbook.

## Mission

The goal of R for the Rest of Us is to help people use R to do good in the world.

## Our Work

The business has two main arms: education and consulting.

### Education

On the education side, we offer:

1.  Self-paced and cohort-based courses

2.  In-person public workshops

3.  Custom training for organizations

### Consulting

On the consulting side, we do a range of projects. Almost all of them involve some combination of:

1.  Data visualization

2.  Using R to improve workflows

3.  Automating reporting (especially with parameterized reporting)

## Roadmap

As a business that does both education and consulting work, the R for the Rest of Us roadmap is guided by internal and external factors. We do our best to be thoughtful about future directions we think are useful based on customer feedback while also leaving space to adjust based on new information.

## A Business with a Social Conscience

R for the Rest of Us is not just a money-making enterprise. I also want it to be a business with a social conscience. We put this into practice by:

1.  Highlighting important issues in the work we do (e.g. the types of projects we work on)

2.  Making it possible for people of various means to learn R (through parity purchasing power and scholarships)

3.  Donating a portion of revenue to organizations working for social justice

## People

R for the Rest of Us is headed by David Keyes. I've outlined my role in [David's Responsibilities](david-responsibilities.html).

Current **consultants** include Charlie Hadley, Thomas Vroylandt, Cara Thompson, Crystal Lewis, and Joscelin Rocha-Hidalgo. Other consultants are brought in for individual projects.
