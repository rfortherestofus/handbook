title: "Client Communication"
---

The most important thing we can do is communicate effectively and regularly. This means getting back to clients within 24 hours. 

The type of communication we use with clients depends on the client. 

- If clients are comfortable working in GtiHub and we decide it is appropriate to have them collaborate on GitHub, feel free to add them to the repo.
- If they don't want to work in GitHub (most don't), email is generally best.

I generally try to send clients updates by email about overall progress every 1-2 weeks to make sure they know what's going on and see if they have any questions.
