## Video Editing

After the instructor provides raw videos, David edits them. Most lessons have the following structure:

- Full screen on instructor as they introduce topic
- Switch to instructor in corner with their screen as background
- As the instructor talks about code, zoom in on it (pan back out when they're done talking about the specific code)
- Switch back to full-screen on instructor when they're not talking about code at all
- Do pans on other websites etc as appropriate
- My Turn as appropriate
- Your Turn as appropriate
