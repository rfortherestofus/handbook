title: "David's Work"
---

As R for the Rest of Us has grown, my work away from doing all of the teaching and all of the consulting to being someone who facilitates others doing this work. In 2021, I make a conscious decision to try to achieve two goals:

1. Increase course revenue
2. Project manage (not do) most consulting projects

To achieve the first goal, I did two things: 

1. I developed a complex system of email automations (see [Email Automation](email-automations.html)) based on what I have learned in the Mastering ConvertKit course
2. Partner with other R users to develop topics courses in areas of their expertise

To achieve the second goal, I have worked with consultants on a range of projects. 

## Core Responsibilities
