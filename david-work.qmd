As R for the Rest of Us has grown, my work away from doing all of the teaching and all of the consulting to being someone who facilitates others doing this work. In 2021, I make a conscious decision to try to achieve two goals:

1. Increase course revenue
2. Project manage (not do) most consulting projects

To achieve the first goal, I do several things: 

1. Partner with other R users to develop topics courses in areas of their expertise
1. Develop content on the blog that brings in users through SEO
1. Develop an [email marketing system](email-automations.html) to educate and sell to customers

To achieve the second goal, I have worked with consultants on a range of projects.
