R for the Rest of Us runs on a **Statamic** website. Details below will be updated soon.

## Featured Images

We create featured images for blog posts starting with this prompt in [Microsoft Designer](https://designer.microsoft.com/). This creates a background image that is then added to [this Canva template](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF9nXMmRH0/9wfI47oEUa20zFF20tcKGQ/edit).

> Create an abstract image with a blue and black gradient background that simulates [TOPIC DISCUSSED]. The image should be 1280 by 720 pixels in size.

To understand the topic discussed, one may need to skim through the blog post/YouTube video. Then, try different versions of your understanding of the topic discussed and see what AI generates.

The images are exported and then uploaded to the website.
