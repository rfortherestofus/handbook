title: "Tools"
---

This is an overview of tools we use. Details on how we use them are laid out in other pages in the handbook.

## Handbook

You're reading the handbook made in **Quarto**. We use Quarto to create internal docs that show how R for the Rest of Us runs. 

## Communication

Email happens through **Gmail**. We have access to the full Google Suite tools, but only use Docs, Sheets, etc periodically. 

**Twist** is where we communicate internally. 

## Task/Project Management

We use **Todoist** to lay out tasks to be done on projects. Generally speaking, we only lay out major milestones on Todoist projects (e.g. finish all data viz on X project on July 23). Communication about specific tasks should happen in the comments section of those tasks. 

Code-based projects have major milestones laid out in Todoist, but then use **GitHub** to discuss individual issues. 

## **Time Tracking**

Time tracking happens in **Toggl**.

## Scheduling

We use **SavvyCal** to schedule meetings with clients.

## Financial

We use **QuickBooks** for accounting and invoicing. 

Payroll happens through **Gusto**.

## Proposal and Contracts

Proposals and contracts are written and sent with **PandaDoc**.

## Design

We use **Figma** and **Canva** to make all design assets.

## Passwords

We manage passwords with **1Password**.

## Website

The website runs on **Statamic** and is hosted using **Laravel Forge** and **Digital Ocean**. 

Website analytics are provided by **Fathom**.

## Video Creation

When providing quick feedback videos, we use **CloudApp** for short videos and **Descript** for longer videos that need to be edited. 

Video editing happens in **Descript**.

Captions for videos are made using the automated transcripts in **muse.ai**.

## Video Hosting

Course videos, teaching videos, etc are hosted on **muse.ai** and embedded on the website.

There is an R for the Rest of Us YouTube channel as well. 

## Social Media

We use **Buffer** to schedule social media content:

## Automation

We use **Zapier** to automate various processes (e.g. when a user completes a course, Zapier sends that data to ConvertKit).
