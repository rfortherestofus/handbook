title: "Project Management"

## Overview

Create a **GitHub repo** (set to private unless the client is ok with it being public):

- Use the **README** to lay out the overall project scope, deliverables, etc.
- Use **issues** to manage code-related questions at a granular level.
- If the project is large enough, use **milestones**. 

Create a thread in the #consulting channel on Twist for the project. This is a good place for things we'd like to keep confidential (because we work more and more with clients directly in GitHub, that isn't the best place for confidential discussions). Communicate updates on overall progress with David using Twist. An update once a week or so is helpful.  

## Client Communication

The most important thing we can do is communicate effectively and regularly. This means getting back to clients within 24 hours. 

The type of communication we use with clients depends on the client. 

- If clients are comfortable working in GtiHub and we decide it is appropriate to have them collaborate on GitHub, feel free to add them to the repo.
- If they don't want to work in GitHub (most don't), email is generally best.

We should email clients each week to give them an overall update on progress and see if they have any questions. 

## Schedule

For each client, we create a file that outlines the milestones in the project and the tasks to be done. This is created as a .qmd file and then rendered to HTML. We then set up Netlify to host the HTML file and share the link with the client. [Here is an example document](https://pmpbusinessreports.netlify.app/).

The schedule should be updated each week when we email the client an update.
