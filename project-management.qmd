## Overview

Create a **GitHub repo** (set to private unless the client is ok with it being public):

- Use the **README** to lay out the overall project scope, deliverables, deadlines, etc.
- Use **issues** to manage code-related questions at a granular level.
- If the project is large enough, use **milestones**. 

Create a thread in the #consulting channel on Twist for the project. This is a good place for things we'd like to keep confidential (because we work more and more with clients directly in GitHub, that isn't the best place for confidential discussions). Communicate updates on overall progress with David using Twist. An update once a week or so is helpful.  

## Client Communication

The most important thing we can do is communicate effectively and regularly. This means getting back to clients within 24 hours. 

The type of communication we use with clients depends on the client. 

- If clients are comfortable working in GtiHub and we decide it is appropriate to have them collaborate on GitHub, feel free to add them to the repo.
- If they don't want to work in GitHub (most don't), email is generally best.

I generally try to send clients updates by email about overall progress every 1-2 weeks to make sure they know what's going on and see if they have any questions.
