Email marketing is the main way that R for the Rest of Us brings in revenue.

All external marketing is designed to get people onto the R for the Rest of Us email list. Once they're on the list, we send them regular emails that educate them about R, interspersing emails that attempt to sell them on our offerings.

The specifics of how our email marketing system works comes largely from [Brennan Dunn's Mastering ConvertKit course](https://createandsell.co/courses/mastering-convertkit). The process gets fairly complicated, but at the highest level, here's what it does:

1.  Get people onto the list

2.  Send them a series of welcome emails

3.  If they're not signed up for the free Getting Started course (most are), try to get them to sign up for that

4.  When they complete the Getting Started course or \~2 weeks after they sign up for the list, try to get them to sign up for the Fundamentals course

5.  Put them onto the "shadow newsletter" (i.e. a series of pre-planned emails they receive every week)

6.  Every \~3 months, try to sell them on a different paid course

Below are details about how email automations work. Note that sequences aren't included because they are generally just called from Visual Automations below.

## Signup

Here are the signup journeys that users experience on the R for the Rest of Us email list.

### Getting Started

If the user gets onto the list by signing up for Getting Started, [they get the tag Purchased - Getting Started applied through the WooCommerce-ConvertKit integration](https://rfortherestofus.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=2816&action=edit).

They then go through the [Getting Started - Signup - Automation](https://app.convertkit.com/automations/547465/edit). This does the following:

1.  Assigns the tag Customer - Course/Workshop
2.  Assigns the tag Customer
3.  Assigns the tag Flag - Calculate Next offer (which sends them through the Function - Calculate Next Offer - Automation)
4.  Assigns the Flag - Remove from Shadow Newsletter tag, which does what it says
5.  Puts them through the [Getting Started - Signup - Sequence](https://app.convertkit.com/sequences/744617), which sends a set of emails about the course
6.  When they complete the course or the Getting Started - Signup - Sequence, they get pulled to the end and go into the Fundamentals - Bridge - Automation

The **Fundamentals - Bridge - Automation** pitches people on Fundamentals. It happens in two ways depending on what the user has done so far on Getting Started.

1.  If the user has the Completed - Getting Started tag, they go into the Fundamentals - Bridge - Hot. This goes straight to the pitch for Fundamentals.
2.  If the user has not completed Getting Started, they go into the Fundamentals - Bridge - Cold. This sends them a few emails before pitching them on Fundamentals.

After they go through the bridge sequences, they go into the Fundamentals - Pitch - Automation.

1.  The tag Flag - Pitch Window Open - Fundamentals gets applied. [This triggers Zapier to create a personalized coupon on WooCommerce](https://zapier.com/editor/106477759/published).
2.  The user gets an email on Friday telling them their personal window is open to purchase Fundamentals.
3.  The user goes through the Fundamentals - Pitch - Sequence, which sends an email every day the next week with info on purchasing Fundamentals.
4.  The tag Completed - Onboarding is applied.
5.  The tag Flag - Start Shadow Newsletter is applied. This triggers the [Shadow Newsletter - Automation](https://app.convertkit.com/automations/547446/edit) and adds them to the shadow newsletter.

### Other Courses

1.  If they sign up for a course, each Woo products assigns them the appropriate tag (e.g. Purchased - Fundamentals).

2.  Then, they go through a visual automation for each course (e.g. Fundamentals - Signup - Automation)

3.  Then, [this automation rule](https://app.convertkit.com/rules#/1977704) assigns them the tag Flag - New Subscriber.

### R in 3 Months

1.  If they sign up for R in 3, WooCommerce assigns them the tag Purchased - R in 3 Months.

2.  Then, they go through [this visual automation](https://app.convertkit.com/automations/899958/edit), which sends them an email that welcomes them. All other communication about R in 3 Months happens directly via Gmail.

### Newsletter

If someone signs up for the newsletter using [this form](https://rfortherestofus.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=ninja-forms&form_id=3), the following happens:

1.  The Flag - New Subscriber tag is added to them through [this automation rule](https://app.convertkit.com/rules#/1977704)
    1.  The Flag - New Subscriber tag puts them into the Global - Welcome - Sequence using [this automation rule](https://app.convertkit.com/rules#/2104767)
2.  The Flag - New Subscriber tag being added puts them onto the [New Subscriber - Automation](https://app.convertkit.com/automations/545990/edit)
3.  The New Subscriber - Automation moves them through the [Function - Calculate Next Offer - Automation](https://app.convertkit.com/automations/896580/edit) and [Function - Tag Custom Training/Consulting Clients - Automation](https://app.convertkit.com/automations/586488/edit)
4.  The New Subscriber - Automation moves them through the [Function - Calculate Topics vs Core Courses](https://app.convertkit.com/automations/915562/edit)
    1.  If they are a custom training/consulting client, they get the Completed - Onboarding and the Flag - Start Shadow Newsletter tags applied, which moves them onto the shadow newsletter
    2.  If they are not a custom training/consulting client, they are moved to the Getting Started - Pitch - Automation (if they haven't signed up for it already)

### You can do that with R

*Note: This one is basically archived. It was a lead magnet early on but isn't really necessary anymore because most people sign up for Getting Started.*

1.  If user signs up for you can do that, it happens with [this form](https://rfortherestofus.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=ninja-forms&form_id=4).

2.  Then, [this automation rule](https://app.convertkit.com/rules#/1977704) assigns them the tag Flag - New Subscriber.

## Shadow Newsletter

Any time the tag Flag - Start Shadow Newsletter is added to a user, they go through the [Shadow Newsletter - Automation](https://app.convertkit.com/automations/547446/edit). This does the following:

1.  Removes the Flag - Start Shadow Newsletter tag (so it can be added again)
2.  Checks if they've completed part 1 of the shadow newsletter. If not, puts them onto that sequence. If so, moves onto the next part.
3.  Repeats the previous step through each part of the shadow newsletter.

After the user completes each part of the shadow newsletter, they get the tag Locked - Pitched added. This puts them onto Function - Move to Pitch - Automation.

New content is constantly added to the last part of the shadow newsletter sequences so that people continually receive emails.

## Pitching

### Calculate Next Offer

[Function - Calculate Next Offer - Automation](https://app.convertkit.com/automations/896580/edit) calculates the next offer for the user by doing the following:

1.  Runs [Function - Calculate Topics vs Core Courses](https://app.convertkit.com/automations/915562/edit) to see what type of course user should be pitched on. That automation adds Flag - Pitch on Topics Courses to those for whom it is appropriate (if they have said they are intermediate/advanced, have said they're interested in topics courses, or have been pitched on all core courses).
2.  If user has Flag - Pitch on Topics Courses, the automation looks at which course they've yet to have been pitched on. It then adds the next course in the following order as their next_offer custom field: Mapping, Data Cleaning, Inferential Stats.

### Move to Pitch

When the user gets put onto Function - Move to Pitch - Automation:

1.  The user gets the Flag - Remove from Shadow Newsletter tag added so they don't get newsletter emails while being pitched.
2.  The user goes through the [Function - Calculate Next Offer - Automation](https://app.convertkit.com/automations/896580/edit), which calculates their next offer
3.  Based on the custom field next_offer, the user is put onto a PRODUCT - Pitch - Automation for their next offer.

### Self-Paced Course Pitch

All self-paced course pitches follow the same rough pattern as Fundamentals:

1.  The user gets an email on Friday (for some courses it's Monday) telling them their personal window is open to purchase Fundamentals.
2.  The user goes through the Fundamentals - Pitch - Sequence, which sends an email every day the next week with info on purchasing Fundamentals.

## Segmentation

Users are segmented by asking questions in the survey on [this page](https://rfortherestofus.com/profile-survey/):

- How would you describe your level of expertise with R?
- Why do you want to learn R (or, if you already use it, learn more)?
- What has stopped you from learning R (or learning more R if you already use it)?
- What's your main tool for working with data?
- How big is the organization you work in?
- What type of courses are you interested in?

Data submitted through this form gets piped back to ConvertKit using Zapier. 

New users also get added to the Global - Profiling - Sequence through the New Subscriber - Automation. This sequences sends them an email each Sunday asking them one of the questions above.
